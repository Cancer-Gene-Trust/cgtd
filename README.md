# Cancer Gene Trust

The Cancer Gene Trust (CGT) is a decentralized distributed database of 
de-identified somatic cancer variants and basic clinical data.

Stewards working directly with patient-participants publish their data to the CGT. 
Researchers that find rare variants or combinations of variants in this global 
resource that are associated with specific clinical features of interest may
then contact the data stewards for those participants.
