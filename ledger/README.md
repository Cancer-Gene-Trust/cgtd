# Cancer Gene Trust Ledger

The CGT is completely de-centralized and as such does not provide any guarantees of provenance. The CGT ledger
is an area for discussions and prototyping using technologies such as Ethereum to add a layer of 'Trust'
to the base CGT distributed database.

To get involved join the ledger discussion at the [CGT Ledger mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/genomicsandhealth.org/forum/#!forum/cgt-ledger)
